Production-ready scaffold for teams that want to ship infrastructure-as-code with Pulumi and Docker from day zero.

## Possibilities

- Pulumi (Python) starter that provisions an AWS EC2 instance and exports connection metadata.
- Reproducible Docker Compose workspace with a Pulumi-ready container and helper `make` tasks.
- CI/CD pipelines for previews and deployments, powered by GitHub Actions and Pulumi Cloud.
- Built-in linting via GitHub Super Linter to keep YAML, Markdown, and workflows healthy.
- Documentation on AWS credential management for secure automation using GitHub OIDC or static secrets.

## Why You Might Need It

Spin up consistent project infrastructure without wiring every component manually. This template gives DevOps teams a single source that:

- Encodes best practices from VilnaCRM’s production stack.
- Works out-of-the-box with AWS and Pulumi.
- Keeps cloud changes reviewable with preview pipelines before production deploys.

```sh
poetry install --with dev

# Configuration validation
make test-pulumi

# Unit tests (pure Pulumi runtime with mocks)
make test-unit

# Automation-based integration tests
make test-integration

make test-mutation
```
