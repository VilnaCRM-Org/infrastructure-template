# Testing and Validation

This repository uses multiple test types so infrastructure-template changes are checked from configuration shape down to the developer CLI surface.

Run `make doctor` first if you suspect the problem is your local Docker or
Compose setup rather than the repository itself.

All coverage-bearing Python suites in this repository are locked to 100% line
coverage. The combined quality gate is also locked to 100% branch coverage
across the Pulumi runtime, policy pack, and Python helper scripts. If unit,
integration, or policy changes reduce coverage, the corresponding `make` target
fails locally and in CI.

## Structural tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-pulumi
```

Coverage:

- Every public Make target is exercised through dry-run or help-output assertions
- `pulumi/Pulumi.yaml`
- `policy/PulumiPolicy.yaml`
- Release workflow contracts
- Dockerfile supply-chain safeguards

## Policy tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-policy
```

Coverage:

- `policy/guardrails.py`
- `policy/pack.py`
- Pulumi policy pack registration in `policy/__main__.py`
- Required tag, public S3 ACL, and open admin-port guardrails
- 100% line coverage for the policy-pack Python surface

`make test-crossguard` is an alias for this same suite.

## Quality checks

Run with:

```bash
make test-quality
```

Coverage:

- `ruff check` for fast linting
- `ruff format --check` for formatting drift
- `ty check` for static typing diagnostics on the `pulumi` and `policy` Python surfaces
- Ruff McCabe complexity with a maximum score of 10
- `radon mi` and `xenon` gates for maintainability and cyclomatic complexity
- Import Linter contracts that keep runtime code and policy code isolated
- Deptry and `uv lock --check` for dependency hygiene

Ty currently ignores a small set of false positives caused by Pulumi's dynamic
`Output.apply` API and the coverage bootstrap shim. The CI command keeps those
exceptions explicit instead of silently disabling the type check.

## Repo hygiene checks

Run with:

```bash
make test-repo-hygiene
```

Coverage:

- `make test-actionlint` for GitHub workflow linting
- `make test-yaml` for GitHub workflow YAML, Pulumi stacks, and operational YAML
- `make test-shell` for ShellCheck and `shfmt`
- `make test-dockerfile` for Hadolint

## Security and preview guardrails

Run with:

```bash
make test-security
make test-guardrails
```

Coverage:

- `make test-secrets` runs Gitleaks against the working tree
- `make test-deps-security` runs `pip-audit --strict`
- `make test-bandit` runs Bandit against repository Python code
- `make test-preview` generates the Pulumi preview artifact consumed by later checks
- `make test-destructive-diff` blocks deletes and replacements of critical infrastructure without an explicit PR override label
- `make test-iam-validation` validates previewed IAM policies with AWS IAM Access Analyzer

Dependency Review, CodeQL, SBOM attestations, and OpenSSF Scorecard are
GitHub-native only. The repository keeps those workflow definitions under
structural test coverage, but there is no local Docker equivalent for the
services themselves.

## Unit tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-unit
```

Coverage:

- `pulumi/app/environment.py`
- `pulumi/app/guardrails.py`
- `pulumi/sitecustomize.py`
- Config fallback behavior for `environment` and `serviceName`
- Identifier validation and fail-fast guardrails
- Best-effort coverage bootstrap behavior when the dependency is present, fails, or is absent
- Component type token and exported outputs
- 100% line coverage for the Pulumi application layer

## Integration tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-integration
```

Coverage:

- The real `pulumi/__main__.py` entrypoint
- Pulumi Automation lifecycle behavior with a local backend
- Real Pulumi policy-pack startup and enforcement through `pulumi preview --policy-pack`
- Guardrail resolution contracts for explicit, configured, and default metadata
- Output wiring for environment metadata
- 100% line coverage enforced for the integration-covered Pulumi runtime files in `pulumi/__main__.py` and `pulumi/app`

The integration suite does not enforce coverage on `pulumi/sitecustomize.py`.
That bootstrap shim is exercised to 100% line coverage in the unit suite,
where its import-failure and startup-failure branches can be tested directly.

The Docker workspace keeps its `uv` virtual environment outside the bind-mounted
repository tree so Pulumi always sees a stable interpreter with `pip`
available for plugin discovery. The policy-pack bootstrap keeps a dedicated
`policy/.venv` in sync from `policy/requirements.txt`, so policy startup and
troubleshooting stay isolated from the main `uv` workspace environment.

## Combined coverage gate

Run with:

```bash
make test-coverage
```

Coverage:

- merges `.coverage.unit`, `.coverage.integration`, and `.coverage.policy`
- enforces 100% branch coverage across `pulumi/*`, `policy/*`, and `scripts/*`
- prevents hidden branch regressions even when each individual suite still has
  100% line coverage

## Mutation tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-mutation
```

Coverage:

- Mutation analysis of `pulumi/app`
- Regression resistance for unit and integration assertions

Mutation testing is the slowest suite and is usually best left to CI unless you are changing component logic directly.

## CLI tests

Run with:

```bash
make test-cli
```

Coverage:

- `make help`
- `make all`
- `make start`
- `make pulumi-preview`
- `make pulumi-up`
- `make pulumi-refresh`
- `make pulumi-destroy`
- `make sh`
- `make down`
- `make test-unit`
- `make test-integration`
- `make test-pulumi`
- `make test-crossguard`
- `make test-quality`
- `make test-repo-hygiene`
- `make test-ruff`
- `make test-ty`
- `make test-maintainability`
- `make test-architecture`
- `make test-dependency-hygiene`
- `make test-lockfile`
- `make test-coverage`
- `make test-bandit`
- `make test-yaml`
- `make test-shell`
- `make test-dockerfile`
- `make test-mutation`
- `make test-cli`
- `make test`
- `make report-quality`
- `make nightly-quality`
- `make clean`

## Full local run

Run the standard local validation battery with:

```bash
make test
make ci-pr
make ci
```

Run `make test` during normal iteration when you want the fast structural, policy, quality, repo-hygiene, unit, integration, coverage, and CLI suites after a prerequisite sanity check. For the same non-mutation battery that GitHub runs in `pulumi-local.yml`, run `make ci-pr`. Before pushing, execute `make ci` to run the full local equivalent of every GitHub check, including the prerequisite check, Docker build, and mutation suite.

GitHub Actions now mirrors `make ci-pr` through the `Pulumi Local Test Battery` workflow, while `Pulumi Mutation Tests` keeps mutation analysis isolated as a separate check.
The `Pulumi Policy Tests` workflow runs the policy-pack coverage suite, and the
`Python Quality Checks` workflow runs Ruff, Ty, maintainability, architecture,
dependency-hygiene, and coverage gates. `Pulumi PR Guardrails` runs preview,
destructive diff, and IAM validation. The `Security Scans` workflow runs
Gitleaks, Bandit, dependency audit/review, workflow linting, YAML linting,
shell hygiene, and Hadolint. `Nightly Quality` publishes Wily, Vulture,
docstring-coverage, and SBOM artifacts.

If Pulumi provider plugin downloads hit GitHub rate limits during local preview
or drift commands, pass `GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)"` only to that single
invocation.

Use `make pulumi-preview` before any real cloud deployment. The preview and
apply targets automatically enable the repository policy pack.
