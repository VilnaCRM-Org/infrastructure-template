# PyCharm Autocomplete for the Pulumi Project

This guide explains how to wire up a local virtual environment so PyCharm can
offer reliable autocomplete for the Pulumi stack. The runtime experience still
happens inside Docker, but PyCharm needs a local interpreter with the project
dependencies indexed to power the editor.

## 1. Create the virtual environment

Decide where you want the interpreter to live:

- `pulumi/.venv` keeps the environment alongside the Pulumi sources.
- `.venv` at the repository root works just as well if you already use that
  convention.

Run the commands below from the repository root, replacing `pulumi/.venv` with
`.venv` if you prefer the top-level location.

```bash
python3 -m venv pulumi/.venv
# Activate the environment (run the line that matches your shell):
#   macOS/Linux:        source pulumi/.venv/bin/activate
#   Windows PowerShell: pulumi\.venv\Scripts\Activate
#   Windows cmd:        pulumi\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "pulumi>=3.138,<4" "pulumi-aws>=7.0,<8" black flake8 pre-commit
deactivate
```

If the virtual environment already exists and you want to refresh the
dependencies, reactivate it (`source pulumi/.venv/bin/activate`,
`source .venv/bin/activate`, `pulumi\.venv\Scripts\Activate`,
`.venv\Scripts\Activate`, `pulumi\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`, or
`.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`) and rerun the `pip install …` line.

## 2. Point PyCharm at the new interpreter

1. Open PyCharm.
2. Go to `Settings → Project: infrastructure-template → Python Interpreter`.
3. Click the gear icon → `Add…` → `Existing environment`.
4. Browse to the interpreter you created (for example `pulumi/.venv/bin/python`
   or `.venv/bin/python`), select it, and apply the change.

PyCharm immediately indexes the environment and enables autocomplete for the
Pulumi SDKs, AWS provider, and the helper tooling (Black, Flake8, Pre-commit).

## 3. Verify autocomplete works

Open `pulumi/__main__.py` in PyCharm and start typing `pulumi.` or
`pulumi_aws.`. You should see completion suggestions for the available modules
and resources. If completions are missing, click the interpreter selection in
the status bar once more to ensure the `pulumi/.venv` interpreter is active for
the project, then re-trigger indexing via **File → Invalidate Caches / Restart…**.

## 4. Keep the environment current

- Whenever `pulumi/pyproject.toml` changes, rerun the `pip install …` command so
  the virtual environment mirrors the project dependencies.
- Delete and recreate the virtual environment if you switch Python versions
  locally.
- The `.venv` folders stay out of version control; each developer should create
  it on their machine following the steps above.
