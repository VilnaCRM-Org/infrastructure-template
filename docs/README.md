# Infrastructure Template Documentation

We follow a docs-as-code workflow: every guide lives alongside the source and evolves through pull requests. Update or add files in this folder whenever you change the infrastructure template so future readers stay aligned with the repository.

## Quick Start

1. **Use this template** or clone the repository locally.
2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. (Optional) Install the [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/) if you plan to run commands outside the container.
4. Launch the local environment:

   ```bash
   make start
   ```

5. Configure your AWS credentials (for example via `aws configure`, environment variables, or GitHub Actions secrets).
6. Run a preview from inside the container to validate infrastructure changes:

   ```bash
   make pulumi-preview
   ```

That is all you need to begin iterating on the sample AWS instance or adapting the stack to your own infrastructure.

## Local Tooling

`make help` prints the available tasks. Most common targets:

```text
start             Initialize and start the Pulumi development environment.
pulumi-preview    Preview infrastructure changes from inside the container.
pulumi-up         Apply the current infrastructure plan.
pulumi-refresh    Sync the Pulumi stack with live cloud resources.
pulumi-destroy    Tear down the stack (irreversible; use with caution).
sh                Open a shell inside the Pulumi container.
down              Stop the Docker Compose environment.
```

## Development

We recommend editing the project through the Docker workspace so IDEs can reuse
the interpreter that already ships with the repository (Pulumi CLI, Python SDKs,
Black, Flake8, Pre-commit).

- [PyCharm autocomplete guide](pycharm-autocomplete.md) — shows how to attach
  PyCharm to the Docker Compose interpreter or create a local virtualenv
  fallback.
- `docker compose up --build -d` launches the workspace; `docker compose down`
  stops it.

## CI/CD and Secrets

Two GitHub Actions workflows handle environment parity:

- `pulumi-preview.yml` evaluates changes on pull requests.
- `pulumi-deploy.yml` applies changes to the `dev` stack on `main`.

Both workflows require AWS and Pulumi credentials. Follow [`docs/github-actions-secrets.md`](github-actions-secrets.md) to configure:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` **or** a GitHub OIDC role.
- `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` for authenticating with the Pulumi Service.

Without these secrets the workflows will fail during the credential configuration stage.

## Project Structure

- `pulumi/__main__.py` – Minimal Pulumi program that provisions an EC2 instance and exports IDs/IPs.
- `docker-compose.yml` – Local development environment with Pulumi tooling baked in.
- `Makefile` – Convenience commands for build, preview, deploy, and container management.
- `.github/workflows` – Automation for previews, deploys, linting, and template synchronization.

## Testing and Validation

Continuous integration runs automatically on every pull request. You can also validate locally:

- `make pulumi-preview` to review planned resources.
- `make pulumi-up` followed by `pulumi stack output` to inspect applied results.
- `pulumi stack history` (from inside the container) to audit state transitions.

## Repository Synchronization

This template feeds other VilnaCRM infrastructure projects through [`actions-template-sync`](https://github.com/AndreasAugustin/actions-template-sync). For authentication guidance, see:

- `.github/TEMPLATE_SYNC_PAT.md` for Personal Access Tokens.
- `.github/TEMPLATE_SYNC_APP.md` for GitHub App credentials.

Remember to grant least privilege, rotate secrets regularly, and monitor workflow logs.

## Security

Report security issues responsibly to the maintainers. Consult [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) and the repository’s [security advisories](https://github.com/VilnaCRM-Org/infrastructure-template/security).

## Documentation Workflow

1. Add or edit Markdown inside `docs/`.
2. Cross-link the new material from `README.md` or other docs so it is discoverable.
3. Include documentation updates in the same PR as related code changes whenever possible.

Feel free to create subdirectories (for example `docs/pulumi/`) to organize the content as it grows.
